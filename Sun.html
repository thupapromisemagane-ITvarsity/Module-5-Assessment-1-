            <h1>The sun</h1>
                <p class="intro">The sun or sol, is the star at the centre of our solar system responsible for the Earth's climate and weather</p>
                
                <p>The sun is an almost perfect sphere with a difference of just diameter between the poles and equator. The average radius of the sun is 695 (109.2 x that of the Earth ) of which 20-25 is core.</p>
                
                <p>If a hellow sun was filled up with spherical Earths then and 960, 000 would fit inside. On the other if these Earths were squished inside wasted space then around 1,300, 000 would fit inside. The sun's surface area is times that of the Earth's.</p>
